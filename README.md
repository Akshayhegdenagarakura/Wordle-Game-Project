Wordle is a simple yet engaging word puzzle game where players have six chances to guess a hidden five-letter word. The game offers feedback on each guess to help players narrow down their options and deduce the correct word.

### How to Play:

1. Make a Guess: Start by entering any five-letter word.
  
2. Receive Feedback:
   - Green: The letter is correct and in the right position.
   - Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - Gray: The letter is not in the word at all.

3. Use the Feedback: Based on the colors, refine your next guess to get closer to the correct word.

4. Keep Guessing: You have up to six attempts to guess the word correctly.

5. Win or Lose: If you guess the word within six tries, you win! If not, the game reveals the correct word.

Wordle is both a test of vocabulary and logical deduction, making it a fun and addictive daily challenge.
